<br><br>
so this was for my si 307: intro to ux design class. the goal of the class was to learn ux design by working towards one end goal. the end goal was to redesign uofm gpt. uofm has some sort of partnership / lease with openai where they get to lease their models and use them for um-gpt.
<br><br>
um-gpt is focused on privacy, ownership, and security. it doesn't learn from the user because it doesn't collect any data. it's improved when openai releases a new model. it automatically deletes every conversation after 30 days. it's completely end to end encrypted.
<br><br>
the advantage for um-gpt specifically is that anything you do on it, is owned by you, which is unlike chatgpt. openai legally has the right to claim ownership for things chatgpt has helped you build. um-gpt doesn't. they waive all rights to ownership, so that every uofm student can use ai tools without worrying about legal protection.
<br><br>
i started out by sketching 8 different ideas for enhancing a normal ai tool (not just “add a button lol”), then pick a direction and flesh it out into a lo-fi task flow for a real user task.for this one we had to stay away from the usual ui homework (login screens, keyboards, text boxes) and instead think about how an ai chat app could fit into someone’s actual day.

these were then converted to more focsued lo-fi wireframes.

i picked a a few of all these ideas and incorporated them into my inital designs.

and then for the final submission, i combined all of this, a bit of the story, some design decisions and a landing page; all into a presentation for <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaellhess/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="underline">micheal hess.</a>
