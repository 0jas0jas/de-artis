assignment description: design a ‘worst possible’ but still plausible tv remote for a user with dexterity and reaction‑time issues.
<br><br>
for this class we had to work backwards: take a boring, everyday object and design the version you’d never want to ship, but technically could. remotes already have a reputation for being cluttered, inconsistent, and hard to use, so this project was about pushing those patterns to the edge while still keeping everything “realistic” enough to manufacture and sell.

<br><br>
this remote is built around one user: someone with dexterity and reaction‑time issues who just wants to watch tv without fighting the hardware. instead, every choice makes that harder. volume and channel live on super‑sensitive side scroll wheels; navigation, media, and power controls are scattered and visually identical; almost every action needs three taps, but the three power buttons only need one. the layout is flat, low‑contrast, and cramped, so you can’t rely on touch or quick glances to find anything.
<br><br>
there’s also deliberately hostile feedback and maintenance. every button press triggers a five‑second car‑horn beep, which is just long enough to be annoying but not long enough to fully discourage you. the only way to power the remote is a hand crank that trades thirty seconds of effort for thirty seconds of use. the device technically “works,” but using it feels like negotiating with it, not controlling it.​

working on this made it way easier to see what good interaction looks like. by intentionally breaking those rules, the project became a checklist of what to avoid the next time i design something people actually have to live with.​
