i did this for <a href="https://www.melwinstonart.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="underline">mel's</a> color theory class.
<br><br>
it was so fun doing stuff in her class. the class would start at like 8pm in the night, and end around 10.30 ish. it was soo chill and so awesome.
<br><br>
everyone would come in, hangout, sometimes we'd all get pizza, and work on our projects together!
<br><br>
mel was awesome <3
