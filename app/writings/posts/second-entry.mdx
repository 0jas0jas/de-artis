i was in a class called auto ux, and the lecturer, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jim-rampton-26a95440/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="underline">jim (james rampton)</a>, is- idk- awesome-
<br><br>
so this class, is about learning to create user experiences for automative purposes, mainly for screens inside a car, and maybe a phone screen for the app that connects to the vehicle. and so, for that purposes, jim somehow managed to get stellantis to bring in their cars, to showcase to the students. we get to pick one from the cars they bring, spend time with them, and then create an experience for that specific car.
<br><br>
honestly i'm just glad this is a new area for me. i'm tired of seeing minimalist design everywhere in the world, and i know i can't change it all. and the fact that i only design stuff for laptop screens or phones makes it all the more monotonous for me. so, designing an experience for a car, very new, scary asf, but just as exciting. a lot to fail in, and a lot more to learn from.
<br><br>
he's also teaching another class, an intro to design, where the goal is to remake the ui and ux of uofm-gpt. what's that you ask? well let me tell you.
<br><br>
uofm, and 4 other unis, apparently have partnered up with openai to sort of lease their models but instead of chatgpt, it's uofm-gpt in the front. this matters because, any work you do using the gpt, is now owned by the university and not openai. it's not like openai sends out cease and desists to things made using chatgpt, but hey it's a possibility, and i'm glad unis are doing something about it at least for their students.
<br><br>
but yeah, i've to remake the ui and ux of uofm-gpt, and i think the top 10 or so will get picked to be developed and actually implemented. i'm glad im in this class coz i already have a lot of experience with figma, but also because it's not a team project, which means if it turns out good, it'll be because i am good. hehe.
<br><br>
i had an information ethics class, where the professor, <a href="https://www.kishonnagray.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="underline">dr. kishonna gray</a>, sent out an announcement on canvas along the lines of "i do not create experiences for people i have not yet met or interacted with."
<br><br>
idk, just seeing this, made me feel nice. she embraces patience, confusion, and the bustle of life. it's okay to take things slow, it's okay to not know what's ahead, it's okay to take time to figure things out. it's really awesome seeing a prof like this, it feels like she really cares about every student of hers.
<br><br>
im also taking a data-programming, and a qualitative research methods class. they're nice, but not really insanely awesome or anything like the above.
<br><br>
p.s. i know my website itself is minimalistic, but cmon this is way better than having a crappy website that doesn't work. it's way better than having a new idea every damn week but never actually implementing it. so instead of making something i want directly, i thought ima take a different approach. so here we are, on a minimalistic site, but yeah, i'll keep on adding stuff to it, and brick by brick, we gona build something much better :>>
