somewhere around 2021 i started liking writing poetry. so i ended up writing a few, and then putting them together for this random company's book publishing contest or something. i couldn't put together more than 17- lmao-
<br><br>
yeah i was really bad back then, and i cringe reading those lines now. but ehh- it is still me doing something i love doing. so im proud regardless.
