i hate minimalism but like i still needed a working portfolio for people to access. something is better than nothing yall, so i made this.
<br><br>
i started using a <a href="https://vercel.com/templates/portfolio/portfolio-starter-kit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="underline">vercel portfolio template</a> and changed stuff one by one. you can do this shi aswell, jus open the vercel starter link.
<br><br>
